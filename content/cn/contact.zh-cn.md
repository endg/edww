# Contact lmg_bit@163.com

​	I love hearing from people, so please email me at [lmg_bit@163.com](mailto:lmg_bit@163.com) and **introduce yourself**.

​	Why? For two reasons:

1. ​	I love getting to know people around the world. (Many of my best friends and even great loves are people who I met when they emailed to introduce themselves.)
2. ​	Because I know a lot of people, I can help **connect** you with someone you should meet.

​	Yes it’s really me, and **I reply to all**.

## Caveat (read first)

​	First [please read my “frequently asked questions” page](/zh-cn/faq).

​	If that page didn’t answer your question, please search my site:



​	I’m not doing any public speaking or interviews now, but might soon, so introduce yourself.

[ 	I don’t promote. ](https://sivers.org/nopr) I don’t invest. And [ 	I’m not taking on any new projects. ](https://sivers.org/no2) But I love to be aware of what you’re doing, even though I can’t get involved or answer questions about it.

​	So really the main reason to contact me is to **introduce yourself**, which I hope you do.

## … or just follow

​	You can follow me using  [RSS](/zh-cn/index.xml).

​	**I don’t check my social media inboxes.** 	So please just email me instead.
