## What I’m doing now

## Focusing

Well, that’s the meta-answer. There are times in my life when my head is up, looking around. And times when my head is down.

Right now I’m completely head-down and focused. Not even reading. Just programming and writing every hour I’m awake. All work. No play.

Except when I’m with my son. I [stop everything](https://sivers.org/dw) then.

## Programming

For 10+ years I’ve been making web apps using only Ruby on the server.

But now I need to make a few new web apps, and update my old web apps,  so I thought it was time to look into a new way of doing things.

After looking into every existing framework and toolkit, I’ve decided to use plain modern JavaScript, no frameworks. So now I’m programming my translation site and storefront to sell my books. It feels nice to start from scratch, and remind myself of the basics.

Most of the real work is done in [PostgreSQL](https://sivers.org/pg).

## Finishing “[How to Live](https://sivers.org/h)”

Many hours a day, finishing the book I’ve been most excited about for the last two years.

It’s coming together really well. I think it’s by far the best thing I’ve ever done.

But more about that, later.

## Weightlifting, 5×5

Three days a week, hit the gym for 45 minutes to do the [5×5 routine](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/is-stronglifts-5x5-the-right-training-program-for-you.html).  Current 5×5 weights as of today:

| squat    | 120 kg  |
| -------- | ------- |
| overhead | 50 kg   |
| row      | 55 kg   |
| bench    | 77.5 kg |
| deadlift | 120 kg  |

## Book, not articles

Until now, I’ve shared all of my ideas in [articles](http://www.964813.xyz). [One idea at a time](https://sivers.org/1idea).

But I’m trying something different this time. I’m saving them, and putting them all in the book.

About 10 times a day, as I’m writing, I think of an idea that would make a good stand-alone article. But instead of stopping to blog, I keep working on the book. Gotta finish. Gotta finish.
