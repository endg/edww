I get emails from many people wanting to change or build their career. I always recommend the best book on the subject: “[So Good They Can’t Ignore You](https://sivers.org/book/SoGood)” by Cal Newport. Here are a few of its best points:

### 	Forget passion and purpose

​	Forget “follow your passion” or “find your true calling”. Stop thinking like that. Here’s why:

​	Words like “passion” and “purpose” are dangerous because they sound huge and romantic. If you think you haven’t found your passion yet, you’re probably **expecting it to be overwhelming** — to hit you like lightning.

​	Looking for your passion, purpose, or calling is an example of the [fixed mindset](https://sivers.org/mindset). You’re assuming that this is an inherent and unchanging thing inside of you, like trying to read your DNA or blood type. But you won’t find passion and purpose there, because **that’s not where those feelings come from.**

​	Passion and purpose are **emotions that come after expertise and experience.** The way to get them is to commit to [the path of mastery](https://sivers.org/book/Mastery), get great at something, and do great work.

​	So instead of looking for passion and purpose, just keep mastering  whatever work you’ve started, becoming more and more valuable in your  field. Passion and purpose will follow a great career.

### 	Great careers are only for the rare and valuable

​	Think of what makes a great career:

- ​	good pay
- ​	room to grow
- ​	freedom and control
- ​	positive impact
- ​	emotionally rewarding

​	Jobs like this are rare and valuable. A great career isn’t something you **find** — it’s something you **earn** when you’ve got **rare and valuable skills to offer in return.**

​	In other words, you can only earn a great career by building your expertise and experience.

### 	Solution: focus on the craft, not passion.

​	The solution to this problem is what’s called “the craftman’s path” — the long-term path to mastery.

​	Everyone who became great at something has a similar story: For years, they worked on their craft every day, even if they weren’t in the mood. Always pushing, practicing, working, and improving.

​	It doesn’t matter if you’re feeling passionate about it that day or even that month. You keep working and keep improving.

​	It doesn’t matter whether your work environment is ideal or you’re being wonderfully rewarded yet. You keep working and keep improving.

​	Yes it takes thousands of hours of practice, but that’s good news! **It’s a clear path and it’s under your control**, instead of dwelling on unanswerable questions like “What is my true calling?”

​	You forget the self-centered concerns about your passion and purpose,  and instead just keep improving and getting really damn good.

​	It doesn’t matter if your current job isn’t perfect. **You just keep improving**, no matter where you are, **becoming more and more valuable**.

​	By building your skills, experience, and value, you earn a great career.

​	By building your skills, experience, and value, **passion and purpose come to you**.

​	By building your skills, experience, and value, you are building your “career capital”.

### 	Career capital: use it to make a change

​	“Career capital” is a metaphor. Think of it like gold tokens you’re earning over years of building your expertise, experience, connections, and reputation.

​	The important point is to **remember how valuable it is**.

​	When you want to make a change to your career, you spend this career capital you’ve earned.

​	But if you’re really sick of your current field and want to switch to another field, **don’t just quit and throw away all the career capital you’ve built up!**

​	**If you’re thinking of quitting your job to follow your passion, please don’t miss this point!**

​	Think of ways you can **use the value you’ve built up** to make the transition to another field.

​	[Like Tarzan](https://sivers.org/tarzan), use your connections, reputation, experience, and expertise to **transition** into a better situation in the new field before leaving the old one.

​	Realize the career capital you’ve built up already, and don’t just throw it away.

### 	Starting from scratch?

​	If you’re starting from scratch anyway, jump into any growing field and start building your skills, expertise, connections, and reputation. Pick a niche and dominate it.

​	If you have no ideas, check out [this list of what startup investors want to invest in](http://www.964813.xyz). And [JWT’s “Things to Watch”](http://www.964813.xyz/) is always fun and inspiring.

### 	Read “[So Good They Can’t Ignore You](https://sivers.org/book/SoGood)”

​	The ideas here are just a little incomplete intro to an amazing book.

​	“[So Good They Can’t Ignore You](https://sivers.org/book/SoGood)” by [Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/), is the best I’ve ever read on the subject of building or changing your career. [Here is a great summary of it.](https://commoncog.com/blog/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/)

​	I just searched my email out-box and found out that I’ve personally  recommended it to people over a hundred times in the past two years.

​	If this subject interests you at all, please [get and read the full book](https://sivers.org/book/SoGood), not just my summary.
