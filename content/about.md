My name is Dan. You can know more about me on the [homepage](/) and my [vitae](../vitae/). This blog is about work, process, life, and fun

This Hugo theme was ported from [Ivy](https://github.com/dmulholland/ivy), a minimalist website generator built in Python. I don't have time to document it. You have to read the source code to understand what it can do. Like Ivy, this theme is also released under [the Unlicense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense), which basically means you just do whatever you want.

All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/). 1
